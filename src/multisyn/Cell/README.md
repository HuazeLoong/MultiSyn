# Integrating Protein-Protein Interaction Network with Omics Data to Predict Anticancer Synergistic Drug Combinations

This project provides a lightweight implementation of the **PRODeepSyn** model to embed cell lines using proteinâ€“protein interaction (PPI) networks and omics targets (e.g., gene expression and mutation). It enables generation of cell line representations for downstream drug synergy prediction tasks.

# Run Instructions
## Step 1: 
```python
python train.py
```
Train cell embeddings (both GE and MUT by default)
## Step 2: 
```python
python gen_feat.py mdl_ge_128x384_sample mdl_mut_128x384_sample
```
Generate normalized cell features from saved embeddings
## Output: 
`data/cell_feat.npy`
